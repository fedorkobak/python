If application logic requires the use of the tool, there are special instruments for parsing the model's attempt to use the tool.\n",
    "- After all, according to the classical workflow, you are supposed to provide to the model with the output of the tool. There is a corresponding tutorial: [How to pass tool outputs to chat models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/tool_results_pass_to_model/).\n",
